<h3>Assignment 1 Problem 0. <i>[5 Marks correctness]</i></h3>
<strong>Problem 0 is a "warm-up" question.  You are allowed to collaborate with your fellow classmates and discuss strategy on piazza.</strong>

<ol type="a">
  <li>Write a Racket module <tt> consecutive-letters.rkt </tt> that provides a predicate function <tt> has-same-consecutive-letter? </tt> that has a single lower-case string parameter <tt> str </tt> and produces <tt> #t </tt> if <tt> str </tt> contains two consecutive letters that are the same, <tt> #f </tt> otherwise.<br>

<strong>The remaining questions are to be completed individually, 
without any assistance from online sources or anyone who is not part of 
the CS 136 staff (ISAs, IAs, Instructors).  Any posts on piazza must be 
for clarification only.  Do not discuss or hint at tricky test cases on 
piazza publically.</strong>
<hr>
<h3>Assignment 1 Problem 1. <i>[15 Marks correctness, 10 hand marking marks]</i></h3>
For this question, the Racket module <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/%7Ecs136/assignments/a1/card-deck.rkt"><tt>card-deck.rkt</tt></a>
 is given (it will appear in Seashell in the directory for this 
question).  The module has two functions already defined for you to use 
in your application module: <tt>build-deck</tt> and <tt>shuffle-deck</tt>. In this question you will write a module that will use the functions within the <tt>card-deck.rkt</tt> module.<br><br>

First, modify and complete <tt>card-deck.rkt</tt> so that it:
<ul>
	<li>provides the functions already defined (that are intended to be used by other modules),
	</li><li>provides functions that will produce the value of each field in the card structure
	</li><li>has all the appropriate documentation and formatting
</li></ul>
<p>Remember to follow good programming practices as described in the course notes and the <strong>new</strong> <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/%7Ecs135/handouts/style.pdf">Style Guide</a>.

</p><p>Next, write a new Racket module <tt>separate-by-suit.rkt</tt> that provides a function <tt>separate-by-suit</tt> that will:
</p><ol>
	<li>use <tt>get-number</tt> (from module <tt>numbers1.rkt</tt> described below) to get a number <tt>n</tt>
	</li><li>shuffle <tt>n</tt> cards in the deck
	</li><li>separate the shuffled deck into 4 piles (one for each suit)
</li></ol>
The function <tt>separate-by-suit</tt> has <strong>no</strong> 
parameters and produces a list of 4 lists of cards (one for each suit) -
 each of the 4 lists will contain the cards all with the same suit.  The
 4 suit lists are ordered by the order of the first card of each suit in
 the shuffled deck; i.e. if the first card is a club, then the first 
list will contain all the clubs, etc.  The cards within each suit list 
are ordered by rank as they appear in the shuffled deck.

<p>The module, <tt>numbers1.rkt</tt>, provides a function <tt>get-number</tt> that your program must use to determine how many cards in the deck will be shuffled. 
Your function should only call <tt>get-number</tt> once; however, for testing purposes you may call it again. Successive calls to <tt>get-number</tt> will produce a number; when it runs out of numbers it will produce <tt>#f</tt>.

</p><p>At the end of the <tt>separate-by-suit.rkt</tt> module add the top-level function application: <tt>(separate-by-suit)</tt>.
  In your past programming assignments, we simply asked you to develop 
functions and our testing program would have
function applications to test them.  In this module, the top-level 
expression will begin the execution of your function (i.e. so when you 
press the "RUN" button in Seashell (or DrRacket), the program will begin
 and you will see the execution results in the console (or interactions 
window in DrRacket).
</p><hr>

<h3>Assignment 1 Problem 2. <i>[15 Marks correctness]</i></h3>
Many games are variations of robots in an arena (question inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboRally">Roborally</a>).
In this question you will implement a module that can be used to help build a similar but very basic game.

The arena is a 100 by 100 grid of squares with the origin in the bottom left corner as illustrated below:
<br><br>
<table border="1">
	<tbody><tr><td> (1,100) </td><td> (2,100) </td><td>  . . . </td><td> (100,100) </td></tr>
	<tr><td> . . . </td><td> . . . </td><td> . . . </td><td> . . . </td></tr>
	<tr><td>(1,2)</td><td>(2,2)</td><td> . . . </td><td>(100,2)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>(1,1)</td><td>(2,1)</td><td> . . . </td><td>(100,1)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>
A robot in the arena will occupy one of the above squares - valid arena locations are stored in type <tt>Arena-Posn</tt>.

<p>Given the following <tt>robot</tt> structure: <tt>(define robot (name orientation location speed))</tt>,
write a racket module <tt>robot.rkt</tt> that provides the following three functions:
</p><ol type="a">
	<li><strong><tt>create-robot</tt></strong> has 5 parameters with the following types: Str, Sym (one of <tt>{'North, 'East, 'South, 'West})</tt>), Nat, Nat, Nat and produces the corresponding <tt>robot</tt>.
	</li><li><strong><tt>move-robot</tt></strong> consumes a <tt>robot</tt> and a list of robot movements (each movement is one of <tt>{'L, 'R, 'F, 'B}</tt> - described below) and produces the <tt>robot</tt> resulting after applying all the movements from the list (in order starting with the first item in the list).
	</li><li><strong><tt>sighted-robots</tt></strong> has two <tt>robot</tt> parameters and produces either <tt>empty</tt>, a list of one <tt>robot</tt> or a list of two <tt>robot</tt>s.  A robots can <em>see</em> along the horizontal or vertical grid cells from their location in the direction they are orientated.
	For example, a robot located at <tt>(4, 5)</tt> oriented <tt>'East</tt> can <em>see</em> grid cells <tt>(5,5),(6,5), ..., (100,5)</tt>.
	The produced list contains all the robots that can be seen by another robot.	
</li></ol>	

A robot may perform the following movements:
<ul>
	<li><tt>'L</tt> is turn-left
	</li><li><tt>'R</tt> is turn-right
	</li><li><tt>'F</tt> is move-forward
	</li><li><tt>'B</tt> is move-backward
</li></ul>
The robot's orientation is the direction the robot is facing - one of the four compass directions <tt>{'North, 'East, 'South, 'West}</tt>.
The robot can only turn at 90 degree increments. So, if facing <tt>'North</tt>, a right turn would change the orientation to <tt>'East</tt>
or a left turn would change the orientation to <tt>'West</tt>.

<p>The robot's location is stored as an <tt>Arena-Posn</tt>.  You may 
assume the compass directions are mapped to the Cartesian plane in the 
natural way (north is the positive y axis, east is the positive x axis, 
etc).
A move forward (or move backward) will change the location of the robot 
in the (opposite) direction that it is oriented.  
The robot will move a distance specified by its <tt>speed</tt>.

</p><p>You do not have to worry about robot collisions;  however, <strong>robots are not allowed to leave the arena</strong>.
  If a robot's movement extends outside the defined indices of the 
arena, reduce the movement so that the robot travels as far as possible 
without leaving the arena (i.e. the robot runs into a wall and cannot 
move through it).   

</p><p>Note (<strong>You are not responsible for implementing this part</strong>
 (yet?)): a basic 2-player game of Robot Arena would start each robot in
 opposite corners.  Then, show the arena layout to the players, ask each
 player for a sequence of 5 movements, move the robots, and determine 
the sighted robots.
A robot that has been sighted is fired upon and exterminated.  Rounds 
repeat these steps until only one robot remains.

</p><hr>
<h3>Assignment 1 Problem 3. <i>[10 Marks correctness]</i></h3>
Many other games (such as Concentration or Memory games) are dependent 
on storing a value at each location of a rectangular playing board that 
is partitioned into
squares (similar to a 2-dimensional grid).  Each square on the playing 
board has a unique (row, column) position.   We will orient our playing 
board with the origin in the bottom left corner (similar to Problem 2). 
 A playing board that has 2 rows and 3 columns looks as follows:
<br><br>
<table border="1">
	<tbody><tr><td></td><td>Col 1</td><td>Col 2</td><td>Col 3</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Row 2</td><td>(2,1)</td><td>(2,2)</td><td>(2,3)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Row 1</td><td>(1,1)</td><td>(1,2)</td><td>(1,3)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>
 
A module <tt>numbers3.rkt</tt> (similar to Problem 1), provides a function <tt>get-number</tt> that you will use to obtain the dimensions of the
playing board and to initialize the value for each square.  The first call to <tt>get-number</tt> produces the number of rows on the playing board.
The second call to <tt>get-number</tt> produces the number of columns on the playing board.  Subsequent calls to <tt>get-number</tt>
 produce the value stored at each square on the playing board, in the 
order: (row 1, column 1), (row 1, column 2), ..., (row 2, column 1), 
(row 2, column 2), ..., and so on.  

<p>Reminder: For testing the correctness of your program, we will change the playing board dimensions and values in the <tt>numbers3.rkt</tt> module.  If properly implemented, your module will still work appropriately. 

</p><p>In this question, your module will need to store the values of 
the playing board as a constant.  How you wish to do so (in a list or a 
structure, etc) is an implementation detail left up to you.  You may 
also create other constants.

</p><p>Write a Racket module <tt>playboard.rkt</tt> that provides the following functions:

</p><ol type="a">
	<li><strong><tt>lookup</tt></strong> has two parameters <tt>row</tt> and <tt>col</tt>, representing the square at (<tt>row</tt>, <tt>col</tt>) on the playing board, and produces the value stored at this square or <tt>#f</tt> if the row or col arguments are outside the dimensions of the playing board. 
	</li><li><strong><tt>match?</tt></strong> has four parameters <tt>row1</tt>, <tt>col1</tt>, <tt>row2</tt> and <tt>col2</tt> representing 2 squares (<tt>row1</tt>, <tt>col1</tt>) and (<tt>row2</tt>, <tt>col2</tt>) on the playing board and produces <tt>#t</tt> if the values of the two squares match; <tt>#f</tt> otherwise.
</li></ol>

Note (<strong>You are not responsible for implementing this part</strong>
 (yet?)): To check for a winning solution to the memory game, you could 
write a function that consumes a list of pairs of square coordinates 
then checks that each pair of squares represent different squares but 
store the same value and all the squares on the board are accounted for 
in the list.  If so, you have won the game.

<h3>Assignment 1 Problem 4. <i>[40 Marks correctness, 10 marks style (hand marking)]</i></h3>

An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Api">Application Programming Interface (API)</a> is an <strong>interface</strong> to a program (application).  The program may even be running on a different computer (e.g., on the internet).

<p>
We have designed a module <tt><a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/%7Ecs136/assignments/a1/uw-api.rkt">uw-api.rkt</a></tt> that provides a Racket interface for using the <a href="https://github.com/uWaterloo/api-documentation">uWaterloo API</a>. This API allows programmers to access and gather information from the University of Waterloo's websites. 

</p><p>
You must write a module <tt>uw-tools.rkt</tt> that requires our uw-api 
module and provides more "user friendly" functions to gather this 
information. The purpose of this assignment question is to give you 
practice using an API and working with interfaces. These skills are 
essential to modern programming, and will be widely used throughout the 
remainder of the course.

</p><p><strong>TIPS: </strong>
</p><ul>
<li>These questions may seem daunting, but they are all just dealing with lists, strings and numbers in different ways.
</li><li>You may find the following functions handy: <tt>number-&gt;string</tt>, <tt>string-&gt;number</tt>, <tt>substring</tt>, <tt>string-append</tt>.
</li><li>It is best to just play around providing different values to <tt> uw-api </tt> in the DrRacket interactions window to see what kind of values it produces.
</li><li>Some of the values produced by the API calls will be lists of lists of lists
</li><li>A few of the questions will require you to explore the <a href="https://github.com/uWaterloo/api-documentation">uWaterloo API documentation</a> to see what is available.
</li><li>Think carefully about what helper functions will make your life easier.
</li></ul>

<p>
The types of the parameter name types are as follows:
</p><ul> 
  <li><tt>subject</tt> is a non-empty string that is a UW subject (e.g., "CS" or "MATH").
  </li><li><tt>catalog</tt> is an integer corresponding the course number (e.g., the catalog
  number for this course is <tt>136</tt>).
  </li><li><tt>term</tt> is a 4-digit integer that uses UW's term 
numbering system (see /terms/list in the api).  If you're curious, the 
first digit is always 1, the next two digits are the year, and the last 
digit is the starting month of the semester (W = 1, S = 5, F = 9), so 
W14 is 1141.
  </li><li><tt>section</tt> is a 7-character string corresponding to a course section (e.g., "LEC 001" or "TST 201").
  </li><li><tt>date</tt> is a 10-character string in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2014-01-10")
  </li><li><tt>building</tt> is a non-empty string corresponding to a campus building (e.g., "MC")
  </li><li><tt>room</tt> is an integer corresponding to a room number (e.g., 4059)
  </li><li><tt>day</tt> is a 1 or 2 character string that is one of: "M", "T", "W", "Th", "F"
  </li><li><tt>time</tt> is a 5 character string in 24-hour format (e.g., "13:30")
  
</li></ul>

<p>
The functions you must provide are as follows:

</p><ol type="a">
  <li><strong>(course-desc subject catalog)</strong> produces a string with the calendar <em>"description"</em> of the course.  <br>For example, <tt>(course-desc "CS" 136) =&gt; "This course builds..."</tt><br><br>
  
  </li><li><strong>(online? subject catalog)</strong> produces #t if the course is available online (or is only available online), and #f otherwise.<br>For example, <tt>(online? "CS" 136) =&gt; #f</tt><br><br>
  
  </li><li><strong>(course-sections term subject catalog)</strong> produces a list of strings that correspond to the section names for the course (see /terms/../../../schedule).  <br>For example, <tt>(course-sections 1141 "CS" 136) =&gt; '("LEC 001" "LEC 002" ... "TST 201")</tt><br><br> 
  
  </li><li><strong>(course-capacity term subject catalog)</strong> 
produces a list of lists illustrating how "full" a course is.  For each 
"LEC" section, it must produce a list with 3 items: the section, the 
enrollment_capacity and the enrollment_total (number of students in the 
class).  <br>For example, <tt>(course-capacity 1141 "CS" 136) =&gt; 
  <br>'(("LEC 001" 94 83) ... ("LEC 006" 94 83))</tt><br><br>   
  
  </li><li><strong>(section-info term subject catalog section)</strong> produces a single string with information about a particular section.  
  To illustrate, <br><tt>(section-info 1141 "CS" 136 "LEC 001") =&gt; 
  <br>"CS 136 LEC 001 08:30-09:50 TTh QNC 2502 Professor Smith"</tt><br><br>
  The format of the string must be:
  <br><tt>"[SUBJECT] [CATALOG] [SECTION] [start_time]-[end_time] [weekdays] [building] [room] [instructor]"</tt><br><br>
  Note: if a section has multiple 'courses' (e.g., MATH 118) use the first class<br>
  Note: if a section has multiple instructors (e.g., CS 458) use the first instructor<br><br>

  </li><li><strong>(next-holiday date)</strong> produces a string with 
the next holiday on or after the date provided.  The string must contain
 the date of the holiday followed by a space and then the name of the 
holiday<br>For example, <tt>(next-holiday "2014-01-10") =&gt; "2014-02-16 Family Day"</tt><br><br>
  
  </li><li><strong>(room-status building room day time)</strong> 
produces a string that displays the course in the room at that day and 
time, or "FREE" if the room is not in use. To illustrate, <br>
  <tt>(room-status "RCH" 112 "T" "11:20") =&gt; "CS 136 Elementary Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction"</tt><br>
  <tt>(room-status "RCH" 112 "Th" "11:21") =&gt; "FREE"</tt><br>
  <br>
  The format of the string must be:
  <br><tt>"[SUBJECT] [CATALOG] [DESCRIPTION]"</tt><br><br>

  <strong><i>fun idea (not required): write a function that takes a list of your classes and produces your schedule.</i></strong><br><br>
  <strong><i>fun idea (not required): write a function that checks a 
list of rooms (e.g., rooms in MC) and displays which rooms are currently
 free.</i></strong><br><br>  
  
</li></ol>

<p>
Note: You may assume the inputs are valid, and you do not have to handle any errors.

</p><p>
Note: You must not assume the results from <tt>uw-api</tt> appear in any particular order.

</p><p>
Note: For our marmoset testing, we will be using a different uw-api
module that has an identical interface, but may produce different results. Your 
code must depend only on what the uw-api specifies, and not on the exact output
it produces. APIs may often change their implementations, but as long as you write
code that depends only on the interface, your code will continue to work.

</p><p>
Note: The uw-api module requires another module named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json">JSON</a>.  If you receive the following error: <tt>"json: standard-module-name-resolver: collection not found"</tt> error, you may have to update your version of Racket.  If you are unable to do so, download the module: <tt><a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/%7Ecs136/assignments/a1/json.rkt">json.rkt </a></tt> and place it in the same directory (folder) as your <tt>uw-api.rkt</tt> module.  Then, modify your <tt> uw-api.rkt </tt> file and change 
<tt>(require json) </tt> to <tt>(require "json.rkt")</tt> 

</p><hr>
